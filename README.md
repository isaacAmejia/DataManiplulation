# DataManiplulation
This Python project focuses on cleaning and merging data from three significant sources to provide valuable indicators for analyzing real estate markets across Texas. The dataset includes information on median household income, unemployment rates, and violent crime statistics, all of which are key indicators that influence the dynamics of real estate investment and market trends.

The project utilizes multiple libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to process data spanning from 2010 to 2023. The first dataset, provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, contains data from the American Community Survey (ACS) on median income levels across Texas counties. Using Pandas, the project strips out unnecessary rows and columns, cleans the income data by replacing placeholders and missing values, and then aggregates the data by county to provide a year-over-year snapshot of median income trends.

The second dataset comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which provides unemployment data for Texas counties. The project filters the dataset for Texas (State code 48), then cleans and restructures the data for use, with attention paid to removing unnecessary columns and rows, renaming for clarity, and ensuring that all data types are correctly set for later analysis. The unemployment data is crucial for understanding the local labor market and its correlation with real estate activity.

The final dataset, Crime in Texas, presents violent crime statistics by county from the Texas Department of Public Safety. This data is essential for identifying the safety dynamics of different areas, which can significantly impact property values and the desirability of certain regions for potential homebuyers and investors. The project filters out non-relevant data, groups by county, and calculates the total number of violent offenses per county, before merging this information into the broader dataset.

The three datasets are then merged on common fields such as "County" and "Year," allowing for a comprehensive view of real estate indicators across the state. The merging process ensures that all data from the different sources align correctly, even though some counties may have missing crime statistics. Finally, the cleaned and merged dataset is exported to a CSV file for further analysis or visualization.

This project demonstrates a solid understanding of data cleaning, manipulation, and merging techniques, utilizing Pandas and NumPy to handle large datasets efficiently. The real-world use case of this project is clear: understanding the relationship between socioeconomic factors (like income and unemployment) and safety (through crime rates) to make informed decisions about real estate investments or policy decisions. The cleaned and merged data can be used for further analysis, such as forecasting property price trends, analyzing market dynamics, or assessing risk factors for investors and homebuyers alike.

To run the file, download the project folder and import the 'RealEstateIndicators.py' python file into your python environment. Then, replace the filepath with the path of the dowloaded folder. Run the entire python script and a .csv file with the final dataset will be exported to the project folder.
